# Dueling Network Architectures for Reinforcement Learning
## Project structure

The two main experiments made are located in the `notebooks/` folder (for dueling network architectures and single stream model for Q-learning) and you can watch the videos of the spaceship landing on the moon in the `videos/`.
All models and their blocks are located in the `src/dueling_archs/models` folder and the corresponding losses in the `src/dueling_archs/losses`.

Run tests with *pytest* from `test/`.
