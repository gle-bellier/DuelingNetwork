# Dueling Network Architectures for Reinforcement Learning
## Project structure

All models and their blocks are located in the `src/perf_gan/models` folder and the corresponding losses in the `src/perf_gan/losses`.

Run tests with *pytest* from `test/`. All data files will be written to the `data/` folder and synthetic dataset generators are located in `src/perf_gan/data`.
